				<h2>About Python</h2>
				<h5>Python <span> Coding</span></h5>
				<p>
					Python coding includes coding with libraries and uses importing functions to write certain programs
					that you are trying to do. Python is usually a beginner level lnaguage most people learn along with
					HTML/CSS. It is overall a great option for expanding knowledge and if you're new to it you should
					most defintely code python as to start out. There are things as nests and they look something like
					this:
				</p>
				<p>
					<br>adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]<br>
					<br>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>

					<br>for x in adj:<br>
					<br>for y in fruits:<br>
					<br>print(x, y)<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Python is typically used as a general programming language and is classed as high-level as it
					provides reading functionality unlike assembly code that is considered low level because only
					machines can read, however that will come later in one of the pages.
