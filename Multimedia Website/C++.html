				<h2>About C++</h2>
				<h5>C++ &<span> Coding</span></h5>
				<p>C++ is a general programming language along with it being the most popular one among programming
					languages. It is classed as a high programming language as it uses english letters an such. It is
					widely used when compiling programs they also use it for making cheat menu also known as SPRX menus.
					These use forms which is a form of application for the program you're designing and makes it into a
					window that you can add functions to by coding it in.</p>

				<p>An example of a C++ application would be<br>
					<br>#include<\iostream\><br>

						<br>using namespace std;<br>

						<br>int main()<br>
						{
						<br>cout << "Hello World \n" ;<br>

							<br>return 0;<br>
							}
				</p>

				<p>This command returns to the console that it will say Hello World, the namespace std is creating a new
					name for that application target, it can use functions, however that example above does not use any
					functions. Functions can include but are not limited to; void, display, public, msg.display and
					return 0; for returning it with a 0 value.</p>
