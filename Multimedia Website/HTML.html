          <p> 
	The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting 		languages such as JavaScript. It isn't considered a programming language but a Markup Language instead because of it use of Hyperlinks, Embedded audio, Iframes and other things that you wouldn't commonly see in other 		coding languages. It is very good for learning how to code for the first time as this allows the creation of things like websites and other various oppurtunities and is mostly used for jobs as software engineers or web designing.               </p>

	HTML code example would be;
	</p>
	<p>
	<br>DOCTYPE html<br>
	<br> ^ This is telling the document to be a .html extension this doesn't necessarily impact the website itself.<br>
	<br>html<br>
	<br> ^ This is asimilar to a variable and is needed for it to be recognised a html page will be created.<br>
  	<br>head<br>
	<br> ^ this is the heading tag which will display code seperate from the body.<br>
    	<br>title: Portfolio website<br>
	<br>^ The above would be what your website tab name would be.<br>
    	<br>link rel="icon" href="ico/My Icons.ico"<br>
	<br>^ The above is for an Icon for your website which will display in the tab name at the left side.<br>
    	<br>link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/HTML.css"<br>
	<br>^ The above is a stylesheet that you will reference if you've made custom CSS for the website.
    	<br>div class="cursor"<br>
	<br>The above ^ creates a class called cursor which you can use in CSS to customise said class.<br>
  	<br>head<br> 
	<br>^ This closes the head by putting a / <br>
